Technical Assessment: Task Management Application
Overview
Welcome to our technical assessment!
This exercise is designed to evaluate your practical skills using modern web technologies.
We're looking for clean code, thoughtful design, and an understanding of best practices.
Use of AI Tools
At atomic, we embrace the use of AI to optimise our output, enhance creativity, and boost
developer productivity.
We believe in leveraging the best tools available to deliver exceptional results, and we
recognise that AI-powered assistants are becoming an integral part of modern development
workflows.
Therefore, you are encouraged to use AI-powered coding assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot,
ChatGPT, etc.) as part of your development process for this assessment.
We're interested in seeing how you utilise these powerful tools to solve problems efficiently.
While these tools can be highly effective, please ensure the solution primarily reflects
your problem-solving approach and understanding.
We encourage you to use them as a valuable assistant, not a replacement for your own
critical thinking.
If you utilise AI tools for significant portions (e.g., generating entire functions or architectural
patterns), please make a brief note in your README.md or as a code comment indicating
where and how AI was used.
This transparency helps us understand your workflow and how you integrate AI into your
development process.
Time Commitment & Expectations
We understand you have other commitments, and we want this assessment to be fair and
respectful of your time.
We anticipate this test will take approximately 2-3 hours of focused work to complete.
Please do not spend more than 4 hours on this assessment.
Our primary goal is to see your approach to problem-solving, your understanding of the core
technologies, and your coding style.
A perfectly polished or fully-featured application is not expected within this timeframe. Focus
on demonstrating your best practices for a functional and well-structured solution.
Submission Guidelines
1. Repository:
a. Create a public or private Git repository for your solution.
b. If private, please invite myself via email.
2. Instructions: Ensure your README.md is thorough enough for us to set up and
run your application without needing to ask clarifying questions.
After reviewing it, we'd be keen to hear your thought process, so please be prepared to
briefly walk us through your work in a follow-up conversation.
If you have any questions during the assessment, please don't hesitate to reach out.
We look forward to reviewing your solution!
