Automatic Zoom
Project Goal: Build a simplified Task Management application.
Technologies:
● Backend: .NET 9 Web API
● Frontend: Your choice of React (with TypeScript) or Angular (latest stable).
● Database: Your choice (below are some examples)
○ In-memory database (e.g., SQLite in-memory, or a simple collection in
.NET) or SQL Server LocalDB or a Dockerised SQL Server/PostgreSQL
instance.
General Requirements & Best Practices
1. Code Quality: Your code should be clean, readable, well-organised, and adhere to
standard coding conventions.
2. Project Structure: Maintain a logical and scalable project structure
3. Error Handling: Implement user-friendly error messages for API failures.
4. Version Control: Submit your solution as a GitHub repository
5. README.md:
○ Clear instructions on how to set up and run both the backend and frontend
components.
○ A brief explanation of your architectural decisions, assumptions, or trade-offs
made.
Core Requirements:
Your solution should implement the following functionalities:
Backend (.NET 9 Web API)
1. Data Model: Create a Task entity with at least the following properties:
○ Id (int, primary key)
○ Title (string, required, max length 100)
○ Description (string, optional)
○ IsCompleted (bool, default false)
○ DueDate (DateTime, optional)
2. RESTful API Endpoints: Implement standard CRUD operations for tasks
3. Data Persistence: Use Entity Framework Core with your chosen database.
4. Business Logic & Architecture:
○ Service Layer: Clearly separate business logic from controllers
○ Dependency Injection: use of .NET's built-in DI.
5. Error Handling: Implement robust server-side error handling
6. Validation: Implement server-side validation for the Task model
7. Project Structure: Organise your backend code logically
8. Unit Tests: Write one or two meaningful unit tests for your backend business logic or
service layer using xUnit/NUnit and a mocking framework (e.g., Moq, nUnit, xUnit).
Frontend (Styling Not Assessed)
Core Task: Create a Single-Page Application (SPA) that consumes your .NET Web API.
1. User Interface:
○ Task List View: Display all tasks, showing title, completion status, and due
date.
○ Task Detail/Edit View: A dedicated view/form to see details of a task and
allow editing.
○ Add New Task: A form to create a new task.
2. Functionality:
○ Display, add, edit, and delete tasks by interacting with your backend API.
○ Provide a way to toggle a task's IsCompleted status directly from the task
list.
3. Form Handling & Validation:
○ Implement client-side form validation (e.g., Title is required). Display
user-friendly error messages.
4. API Integration:
○ Use HttpClient (Angular) or fetch/axios (React) to communicate with
the backend.
5. Routing:
○ Implement basic client-side routing to navigate between different views (e.g.,
task list, add/edit task).
6. State Management:
○ Demonstrate a clear understanding of state management within your chosen
framework.
○ (Optional) Implement a robust state management solution like Redux
Toolkit/Ngrx, or a well-structured Context API/service-based approach.
7. Client-Side Filtering, Sorting, Pagination:
○ Implement UI controls for the enhanced task list features that interact with the
backend API's filtering, sorting, and pagination parameters.
8. Frontend Tests: Write a few unit tests for key components or services.
○ Please include one or two basic end-to-end (E2E) tests using Playwright to
demonstrate a full user flow.
Bonus Section (Optional): Advanced Considerations
If you're eager to showcase a deeper level of expertise and have additional time beyond the
core requirements, consider addressing some of the following points.
These are not mandatory for a successful submission but will provide a stronger indicator of
senior-level design and thought processes.
1. Data Model: Add CreatedDate, LastModifiedDate, CreatedBy (User ID),
AssignedTo (User ID).
2. README.md:
○ (Optional) Also include a brief discussion on how you might approach
scalability, security considerations, and potential deployment strategies for
this application in a production environment.)
3. Backend
○ Filtering, Sorting, Pagination:
i. Enhance the GET /api/tasks endpoint to support querying tasks by
completion status, due date range, sorting options (e.g., by title, due
date), and basic pagination.
4. Enhanced Code Quality & Maintainability:
○ Demonstrate exceptional code clarity, consistency, and adherence to
advanced style guides.
○ Show sensible use of design patterns (e.g., Mediator, Strategy, Decorator
where applicable) to enhance modularity and maintainability.
○ Focus on clean architecture principles, emphasizing loose coupling and high
cohesion throughout the application.
5. Advanced Documentation:
○ Beyond basic setup, discuss your architectural decisions in more detail within
your README.md or a separate Decisions.md file.
○ Integrate basic API Documentation (e.g., Swagger/OpenAPI) for the backend.
○ Ensure effective code commenting where necessary to explain complex logic,
while always prioritizing self-documenting code.
6. Deeper Version Control Insights:
○ Showcase a well-structured Git history with atomic, clear, and concise commit
messages that tell a story of your development process.
7. Scalability & Performance Discussion:
○ In your README.md or a separate Decisions.md file, discuss potential
performance bottlenecks you identified (or anticipate) and how you addressed
them within your solution or would address them in a production environment.
8. Security Discussion:
○ Elaborate on any security measures implemented (e.g., detailed JWT
handling, HTTPS considerations, robust input validation, CORS policies).
○ Mention other critical security considerations for a real-world application, such
as secure password hashing, SQL injection prevention, XSS prevention, rate
limiting, etc.
